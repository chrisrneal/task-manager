## Task Fields

The task management system uses a flexible custom fields approach for all task metadata:

### Built-in Fields
- **Name**: Task title (required)
- **Description**: Detailed task description
- **Task Type**: Defines the workflow and available custom fields
- **State**: Current position in the task's workflow

### Custom Fields
All other task properties (such as Priority, Due Date, Story Points, etc.) are implemented as custom fields. This provides several advantages:

- **Flexibility**: Each project can define exactly the fields needed for their workflow
- **Consistency**: All task metadata uses the same underlying system
- **Customization**: Field types, validation, and requirements can be tailored per project
- **Migration Support**: Existing tasks retain their original Status, Priority, and Due Date values through automatic migration to custom fields

When migrating from earlier versions, the system automatically creates Status, Priority, and Due Date custom fields and preserves all existing task data.

## Task Management

The application allows users to:
- Create and manage projects
- View projects in different formats (Kanban board, List view, or Gantt chart)
- Add tasks with details like name, description, and custom fields
- Organize tasks in customizable boards
- Track task progress through workflows
- Attach files (images, PDFs) to tasks with secure access control

### Task Creation Workflow

When creating a new task from a project page, the application provides a streamlined workflow:

1. **Create Task**: Fill out the task creation form with name, description, task type, and custom fields
2. **Automatic Redirect**: After successful creation, you're automatically redirected to the task detail page
3. **Edit Mode Enabled**: The task detail page opens with edit mode automatically enabled (indicated by the `?edit=true` URL parameter)
4. **Immediate Editing**: You can immediately continue editing the task without additional navigation or clicking the edit button

This workflow improvement eliminates the need to manually navigate to the newly created task and enables immediate editing, making the task creation process more efficient.

### Task Assignment

Tasks can be assigned to project members through an assignment dropdown that:
- **Shows Current Assignment**: Displays the currently assigned user as the selected option
- **Lists Project Members**: Shows all project members with their names and roles (e.g., "John Doe (admin)")
- **Dynamic Updates**: Updates in real-time when project membership changes

## Task Files

### Security Features

- **Supabase Storage Integration**: Files are stored in a secure, private bucket
- **Row-Level Security**: Files inherit the same access control as their parent tasks
- **Signed URLs**: File downloads use temporary signed URLs with 60-minute expiry
- **Type Validation**: Only allowed file types (JPEG, PNG, PDF) can be uploaded
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file size of 10 MB enforced

### Implementation

Files can be uploaded to tasks using a drag-and-drop interface. Each task can have multiple file attachments, with thumbnails for previewing images and icons for PDFs. File deletion is available with confirmation to prevent accidental removal.

## Project Management

### Project Views

Projects can be viewed in multiple formats using a tabbed interface:

- **Kanban**: The default board-style view showing tasks organized by workflow states. Tasks can be dragged between states following the defined workflow rules.
- **List**: A table-style view showing all tasks with sortable columns including name, status, and type, along with any custom fields configured for the project. This view makes it easy to scan and sort all tasks in a project.
- **Gantt**: (Coming Soon) A timeline view for visualizing task schedules and dependencies.

Users can switch between these views using tabs at the top of the project page, with smooth transitions between each view.

### Project Settings

Project owners and administrators can access the Project Settings page to:

- **Edit Project Details**: Update the project name and description
- **Manage Workflow States**: Configure custom states for task organization
- **Create Workflows**: Define sequences of states for different task types
- **Configure Task Types**: Set up different task types (Bug, Feature, Epic, etc.) with associated workflows

Access to project settings is restricted to project owners and users with admin privileges.

## Custom Fields

Custom fields allow project administrators to extend the standard task structure with additional, project-specific properties that capture the unique requirements of different workflows and organizations.

### Adding Custom Fields in the UI

1. **Navigate to Project Settings**: Access the project settings page for the project where you want to add custom fields.
2. **Select Fields Tab**: Choose the "Fields" tab in the project settings.
3. **Create a New Field**:
   - Enter a field label (name)
   - Select the input type (text, textarea, number, date, select, checkbox, radio)
   - Mark as required if necessary
   - Assign to specific task types within the project
4. **Save the Field**: Click "Add Field" to create the field
5. **Manage Existing Fields**: Edit, delete, or reassign fields to different task types as needed

All created fields will automatically appear in task forms when creating or editing tasks of the assigned task types.

### How Field Values Are Stored

Custom field values are stored in a structured, normalized database schema:

1. **Field Definitions**: Stored in the `fields` table with properties:
   - `id`: Unique identifier for the field
   - `project_id`: The project the field belongs to
   - `name`: Display name of the field
   - `input_type`: Type of field (text, number, etc.)
   - `is_required`: Whether the field is mandatory

2. **Field Assignments**: Stored in the `task_type_fields` junction table:
   - `task_type_id`: The task type the field is assigned to
   - `field_id`: The field being assigned

3. **Field Values**: Stored in the `task_field_values` table:
   - `task_id`: The task the value belongs to
   - `field_id`: The field this value is for
   - `value`: The actual field value (stored as text)

This structure ensures data integrity while keeping the schema flexible for adding new field types.

### Querying Field Values in Supabase SQL

#### Basic Field Value Query

```sql
-- Get all tasks with their field values
SELECT 
  t.id as task_id,
  t.name as task_name,
  f.name as field_name,
  tfv.value as field_value
FROM 
  tasks t
JOIN 
  task_field_values tfv ON t.id = tfv.task_id
JOIN 
  fields f ON tfv.field_id = f.id
WHERE 
  t.project_id = 'your-project-id';
```

#### Filter Tasks by Field Value

```sql
-- Find tasks with a specific field value
SELECT 
  t.id, 
  t.name
FROM 
  tasks t
JOIN 
  task_field_values tfv ON t.id = tfv.task_id
JOIN 
  fields f ON tfv.field_id = f.id
WHERE 
  f.name = 'Priority Level'
  AND tfv.value = 'High'
  AND t.project_id = 'your-project-id';
```

#### Pivot Field Values to Columns

```sql
-- Pivot fields into columns (using Postgres crosstab)
SELECT *
FROM crosstab(
  'SELECT 
     t.id, 
     f.name, 
     tfv.value
   FROM 
     tasks t
   JOIN 
     task_field_values tfv ON t.id = tfv.task_id
   JOIN 
     fields f ON tfv.field_id = f.id
   WHERE 
     t.project_id = ''your-project-id''
   ORDER BY 1,2',
  'SELECT name FROM fields WHERE project_id = ''your-project-id'' ORDER BY 1'
) AS (
  task_id UUID,
  "Priority" TEXT,
  "Story Points" TEXT,
  "Department" TEXT
  -- Add expected field names here
);
```

## Workflow System

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Board Columns**: Task boards render columns from workflow states instead of hardcoded statuses
- **Workflow State Transitions**: Tasks can only move to valid next states in their workflow
- **Task Type Integration**: Changing a task's type automatically updates its workflow and resets to the first state
- **Branching & Cyclical Workflows**: States can have multiple outgoing transitions, enabling complex workflow patterns
- **Any-State Transitions**: Special transitions that allow moving to a specific state from any other state
- **Interactive Workflow Editor**: Canvas-based UI for visually creating and managing workflow transitions
- **Two-layer Validation**:
  - Frontend: UI only shows valid state options based on current workflow position
  - Backend: Database constraints validate state transitions server-side

### How It Works

1. Each project can have multiple task types (e.g., Bug, Feature, Epic)
2. Task types are associated with specific workflows
3. Workflows define a graph of states with transitions between them (shown as columns on the board)
4. States can branch to multiple possible next states (e.g., "In Progress" ‚Üí "Needs Review" or "Blocked")
5. Cyclical workflows allow returning to previous states
6. When creating or editing a task:
   - Selecting a task type assigns its workflow
   - Only valid state transitions are allowed
   - Changing task type resets the workflow state

### Technical Implementation

The workflow system is implemented with:

- Database schema with `workflows`, `workflow_steps`, `workflow_transitions`, `task_types`, and `project_states` tables
- Transitions with placeholder UUID (all zeros) for from_state represent "any state" transitions
- PostgreSQL trigger function to validate state transitions
- Interactive canvas-based workflow editor with SVG for transition visualization
- React components for dynamic board rendering
- Frontend logic to manage workflow state changes
