## Features

- ‚ú® Modern PWA using Next.js
- üåó Dark and light themes
- üì± Responsive design for all devices
- üîÑ Real-time updates with Supabase
- üîê Secure authentication
- üìä Customizable project dashboards
- üöÄ Dynamic task board with workflow states
- üîÑ Workflow-driven task transitions

## Task Management

The application allows users to:

- Create and manage projects
- Edit project names and descriptions from Project Settings (for project owners and admins)
- Add tasks with details like name, description, priority, and due date
- Organize tasks in customizable boards
- Track task progress through workflows

## Project Management

### Project Settings

Project owners and administrators can access the Project Settings page to:

- **Edit Project Details**: Update the project name and description
- **Manage Workflow States**: Configure custom states for task organization
- **Create Workflows**: Define sequences of states for different task types
- **Configure Task Types**: Set up different task types (Bug, Feature, Epic, etc.) with associated workflows

Access to project settings is restricted to project owners and users with admin privileges.

## Workflow System

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Board Columns**: Task boards render columns from workflow states instead of hardcoded statuses
- **Workflow State Transitions**: Tasks can only move to valid next states in their workflow
- **Task Type Integration**: Changing a task's type automatically updates its workflow and resets to the first state
- **Branching & Cyclical Workflows**: States can have multiple outgoing transitions, enabling complex workflow patterns
- **Any-State Transitions**: Special transitions that allow moving to a specific state from any other state
- **Interactive Workflow Editor**: Canvas-based UI for visually creating and managing workflow transitions
- **Two-layer Validation**:
  - Frontend: UI only shows valid state options based on current workflow position
  - Backend: Database constraints validate state transitions server-side

### How It Works

1. Each project can have multiple task types (e.g., Bug, Feature, Epic)
2. Task types are associated with specific workflows
3. Workflows define a graph of states with transitions between them (shown as columns on the board)
4. States can branch to multiple possible next states (e.g., "In Progress" ‚Üí "Needs Review" or "Blocked")
5. Cyclical workflows allow returning to previous states
6. When creating or editing a task:
   - Selecting a task type assigns its workflow
   - Only valid state transitions are allowed
   - Changing task type resets the workflow state

### Technical Implementation

The workflow system is implemented with:

- Database schema with `workflows`, `workflow_steps`, `workflow_transitions`, `task_types`, and `project_states` tables
- Transitions with placeholder UUID (all zeros) for from_state represent "any state" transitions
- PostgreSQL trigger function to validate state transitions
- Interactive canvas-based workflow editor with SVG for transition visualization
- React components for dynamic board rendering
- Frontend logic to manage workflow state changes

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up your Supabase environment variables
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## AI Automation

This repository is configured for GitHub Copilot to help maintain documentation and code consistency. When code changes are made:

- Copilot may suggest or open PRs that update documentation to reflect code changes
- All PRs will be reviewed through the normal process
- Copilot follows the existing code standards and styles in the repository
