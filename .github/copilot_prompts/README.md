# Copilot Prompts Examples

This directory contains example prompts for effective collaboration with GitHub Copilot in this repository. Use these as templates to help Copilot understand your intentions for the codebase.

## Implement a Feature and Update Documentation

```
Implement a feature to [describe the feature] in the codebase. Make sure to:

1. Follow the existing patterns and standards in the repository
2. Write clean, maintainable code with appropriate error handling
3. Add tests that verify the feature works correctly
4. Update the README.md or relevant documentation to explain the new feature
5. Ensure the code passes all linting and test checks
```

## Refactor Code While Preserving Tests

```
Refactor the [specify component/module/file] to improve [performance/readability/maintainability] while:

1. Maintaining the same API interface and behavior
2. Ensuring all existing tests continue to pass
3. Following the project's code style and best practices
4. Minimizing changes to the public interface
5. Adding comments for complex logic or explaining the refactoring approach
```

Feel free to adapt these prompts to your specific needs, and add more examples as the project evolves.
